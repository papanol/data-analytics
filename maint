Maintenance Culture Improvement & PM Transformation Plan
1. Problem Statement (Current State)
Key Issues Identified

Tool storage & shelves

Poor organization, no ownership

Time wasted searching for tools

Duplicate purchases & missing tools

Preventive Maintenance (PM) execution

PMs are too broad (entire press at once)

Inspections rushed or skipped due to time pressure

Findings are not consistently captured or actioned

PM + Repairs conflict

Inspections and repairs attempted at the same time

Leads to incomplete inspections and reactive work

No proper planning window

Understaffing reality

PM scope does not match available manpower

Technicians forced into firefighting mode

2. Vision & Objectives (Future State)
Maintenance Vision

Shift from reactive firefighting to planned, equipment-focused maintenance driven by data, ownership, and preparation.

Objectives

Reduce unplanned downtime

Improve PM quality and consistency

Make maintenance work visible, planned, and achievable

Build technician ownership and pride

Improve safety and efficiency

3. Phase 1 – Foundation (Weeks 1–3)
3.1 Launch Maintenance Culture Reset

Kickoff Meeting (1–1.5 hrs)
Participants:

Maintenance techs

Maintenance manager/supervisor

Process engineer (you)

Production representative

Agenda:

Why current system isn’t working (facts, not blame)

Explain new direction:

PM ≠ repairs

Inspections first, planning second

Ask techs:

What PMs are unrealistic?

What tools/parts are always missing?

Which machines fail most?

👉 This creates buy-in and ownership early.

3.2 5S Tool Storage Reorganization (Pilot Area First)
Step 1: Sort

Remove broken, duplicate, unused tools

Tag questionable items (red tags)

Step 2: Set in Order

Assign tools by:

Machine group (Press, Saw, Puller, Stretcher)

Shadow boards with:

Tool outlines

Labels

Frequently used tools at waist height

Step 3: Shine

Clean shelves, drawers, toolboxes

Fix damaged shelving

Step 4: Standardize

Photos of “correct setup”

Simple posted rules:

Tool home location

End-of-shift check

Step 5: Sustain

Assign area ownership (one tech per area)

Weekly 5-minute audit checklist

📌 Deliverable:

One fully 5S’d maintenance area as a model zone

4. Phase 2 – PM System Redesign (Weeks 2–6)
4.1 Shift From “Press PM” → “Machine-Focused PMs”
Current (Problem)

One PM for entire press

Too many components

Not enough time → poor execution

Future (Solution)

Break PMs into individual machines:

Example – Press Line:

Billet Saw PM

Billet Oven PM

Press Hydraulics PM

Upper Puller PM

Lower Puller PM

Run-Out Table PM

Finishing Saw PM

Each PM should:

Take 30–90 minutes max

Focus on what actually fails

4.2 PM Structure (Standard Template)

Each PM includes:

Inspection only (no repairs)

Condition-based checks:

Visual

Listen

Feel

Measure (where applicable)

Simple pass/fail or condition scale:

OK

Monitor

Action Required

📌 Rule:

If repair takes >10–15 minutes → log it, don’t fix it during PM.

5. Phase 3 – Separate Inspections from Repairs (Critical Change)
5.1 Saturday = Inspection & Planning Day

Saturday (Low or No Production)

Perform PM inspections only

Capture:

Findings

Photos

Measurements

Create work orders for:

Repairs

Parts needed

Labor estimates

No major repairs on Saturday unless safety-critical.

5.2 Weekday = Planned Repairs During Production Windows

Repairs scheduled during:

Planned downtime

Changeovers

Assigned maintenance windows

Jobs are:

Pre-planned

Parts staged

Tools ready

📌 This eliminates:

Guesswork

Emergency scrambling

Incomplete jobs

6. Phase 4 – Planning & Visibility (Weeks 4–8)
6.1 Maintenance Planning Board (Physical or Digital)

Sections:

Backlog (Approved jobs)

This Week

Today

Waiting on Parts

Completed

Each job shows:

Machine

Problem

Estimated time

Priority

6.2 PM Frequency Based on Risk (Not Calendar Only)
Equipment	Failure Impact	PM Frequency
Finishing Saw	High	Weekly
Puller	High	Weekly
Billet Oven	Medium	Bi-weekly
Press Hydraulics	High	Monthly
Conveyors	Low	Monthly
7. Phase 5 – Metrics & Sustainment (Week 8+)
7.1 Track the Right Metrics

% PMs completed on time

of PM findings → planned work orders

Emergency breakdowns per month

Downtime by machine (Pareto)

7.2 Monthly Review (30 mins)

What PMs found issues early?

What failures were still surprises?

Adjust PM content, not just frequency

8. Roles & Ownership
Role	Responsibility
Maintenance Techs	Execute PMs, log findings
Maintenance Supervisor	Schedule, approve backlog
Process Engineer (You)	Data analysis, PM optimization
Production	Protect PM & repair windows
9. Expected Outcomes
Short Term (1–2 months)

Faster tool access

Better PM completion quality

Clear repair planning

Medium Term (3–6 months)

Reduced emergency breakdowns

Improved technician morale

Better downtime data

Long Term

Strong maintenance culture

Predictable maintenance workload

Data-driven reliability improvements
