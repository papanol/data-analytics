Use a “Before → Change → After” Improvement Log (Core Record)
This is your single source of truth.
Create a simple Excel sheet or SharePoint list with these columns:
📊 Final Pack Improvement Log
Date	Area	Problem Observed	Change Implemented	Why (Lean Reason)	Owner	Result (Measured)	Status
Feb 26	Final Pack	Items scattered, double handling	Dedicated IPT & Finished zones	Reduce motion & confusion	Papa	Walk distance ↓ ~30%	Sustained


2. Track Only 4 Metrics (Don’t Overcomplicate)
For Final Pack, these are the right metrics:
✅ Required Metrics
Record before vs after, even if estimated.
1.	Output per shift
o	Bundles / skids / pieces packed
2.	Pack lead time
o	Start → wrapped & staged
3.	Rehandling / interruptions
o	of times work was stopped or moved
4.	Space usage
o	Visual: congested vs clear zones

3. Use Visual Proof (This Is Powerful)
Management believes what they see.
📸 Visual Change Log
Create a folder or PowerPoint with:
•	Before photos
•	After photos
•	1 sentence caption:
“Dedicated Finished Goods Zone reduced searching and cross-traffic.”.

4.Update the Work Instruction (Control the Gain)
Any improvement that works must be locked in.
For each sustained change:
•	Update the Final Pack Work Instruction
•	Add:
o	Zone definitions
o	Role clarity (packer vs helper vs lead)
o	What to do during rush jobs
5. Use a Simple PDCA Header (Leadership Language)
At the top of your improvement log or email updates:
PDCA Snapshot
•	Plan: Reduce wasted motion and confusion
•	Do: Created dedicated IPT & Finished zones
•	Check: Packing output ↑, interruptions ↓
•	Act: Update work instruction & train team
This shows structured thinking, not just firefighting.
PCDS = Process Control & Documentation System
It is a structured way to:
•	Define how a process should run
•	Record changes
•	Track deviations
•	Control documentation
•	Sustain improvements
Think of it as the “process brain” of a department.
What PCDS Typically Includes
In a Final Pack department, a PCDS would contain:
1️⃣ Standard Work
•	Work instructions
•	Role definitions
•	Flow layout
•	Break coverage rules
•	Rush job protocol
________________________________________
2️⃣ Process Controls
•	What must be checked (dimensions, wrap quality, labeling)
•	When to check it (per skid, per hour, per job)
•	Who checks it (packer, lead, QA)
________________________________________
3️⃣ Change Log
•	What was changed
•	Why it was changed
•	Who approved it
•	When it was implemented
This prevents:
•	Random changes
•	Loss of improvements
•	“We used to do it this way” confusion
________________________________________
4️⃣ Metrics Dashboard
For Final Pack, this could track:
•	Output per shift
•	Rework rate
•	Interruptions / rush frequency
•	Space utilization
•	Labor efficiency
________________________________________
5️⃣ Revision Control
Each document has:
•	Version number
•	Revision date
•	Owner
•	Approval signature
This makes it audit-proof.

How It Applies to Final Pack
For your pack department improvements, a simple PCDS might include:
•	Final Pack Work Instruction (Rev 2)
•	Layout Map (zones defined)
•	Rush Job Procedure
•	2-Hour Reporting Sheet
•	Improvement Log
•	Weekly KPI Dashboard
All in one controlled folder.


1. Define “Staffing Modes” (This is the Key)
Create standard operating modes based on how many people are present.
🔹 Final Pack Staffing Modes
Mode	Headcount	When Used
Mode A	2 people	Breaks, absenteeism
Mode B	3 people	Normal steady state
Mode C	4 people	High volume / rush
This goes directly into your PCDS.
________________________________________
2. Role Allocation by Headcount (Very Important)
Instead of fixed roles, define role coverage per mode.
📌 Mode A – 2 People
•	Person 1: Primary pack + wrap
•	Person 2: Material handling + staging
•	❗ Only one job active at a time
________________________________________
📌 Mode B – 3 People
•	Person 1: Packing
•	Person 2: Wrapping / banding
•	Person 3: Staging / material replenishment
•	✅ One job active, second staged only
________________________________________
📌 Mode C – 4 People
•	Person 1 & 2: Packing
•	Person 3: Wrapping / labeling
•	Person 4: Staging / QA check
•	✅ Two jobs allowed only if space permits
This removes confusion instantly.
________________________________________
3. Add a “Mode Trigger Rule”
This prevents chaos when people leave or return.
🔁 Staffing Change Rule
“When headcount changes, the pack lead immediately switches to the corresponding mode and communicates role changes.”
This sentence is gold for audits and leadership.
________________________________________
4. Record This in PCDS (Where It Lives)
Add a section titled:
Final Pack – Staffing Control Matrix
Include:
•	Mode A / B / C
•	Role assignments
•	Job limits
•	Space rules
This becomes controlled standard work.
________________________________________
5. How You Measure Improvement Under Variable Staffing
You don’t compare all shifts equally.
Instead, record output by mode:
Date	Mode	Headcount	Output	Issues
Feb 26	A	2	18 skids	No delays
Feb 26	C	4	42 skids	Space tight
This is how professionals do it.
________________________________________
6. How You Explain This to Leadership (Use This Line)
“Final Pack performance is controlled by staffing mode. We’ve standardized flow and role coverage for 2, 3, and 4-person scenarios to prevent interruptions and wasted motion.”
That sentence alone shows systems thinking.
________________________________________
7. What This Prevents
•	People doing the same task
•	Half-started jobs everywhere
•	Rush jobs blowing up flow
•	Blame during low staffing periods
1. First: What This Data Actually Is (Reframe It)
This sheet is effectively a historical time-and-output log for Final Pack / SAP-IPT work, showing:
•	Date & time window
•	Area (FINALPACK, SAP-IPT, SAP-SUB)
•	Job / profile
•	Quantity processed
•	Time spent
•	Headcount
•	Calculated performance (% or rate)
👉 This is not just “past data” — it is baseline performance under uncontrolled conditions.
That’s important language.
________________________________________
2. Establish the BASELINE (This Is Step 1)
Before any change, you must say:
“This is how the process performed before standardization.”
What you extract (very simple):
From this data, summarize:
•	Average output per hour
•	High variation between rows
•	Same headcount → wildly different results
•	Very high % swings (50% → 250%)
That variation is your justification.
📌 Key message:
“Performance is inconsistent because the process is not controlled.”
________________________________________
3. Show Variability = Lack of Standard Work
Look at these patterns in your sheet:
•	Same department (FINALPACK)
•	Same headcount (2 or 3)
•	Similar time blocks (30–40 min)
•	Output swings massively
That tells leadership:
•	People are working hard
•	But everyone is working differently
Use this sentence:
“The data shows high variability under similar conditions, indicating a lack of standardized flow, role clarity, and space control.”
This is Lean language leadership understands.
________________________________________
4. Segment the Data by Staffing (Critical)
Now connect this to what you already identified.
Break the data into:
•	2-person periods
•	3-person periods
•	4-person periods
Then calculate:
•	Avg output per mode
•	Best vs worst case per mode
📊 This allows you to say:
“Performance changes significantly with headcount, but there is no defined operating model for each scenario.”
This directly justifies:
•	Staffing modes
•	Role allocation
•	Job limits per mode
________________________________________
5. Identify Waste Directly From the Numbers
You don’t need to “observe” waste — it’s already here.
What the data implies:
•	Low output in long time blocks → waiting / searching
•	High % over 100% → rushing / overburden
•	Big drops immediately after → burnout or congestion
Use this line:
“The process alternates between underutilization and overburden, which is not sustainable.”
That’s textbook Lean.
________________________________________
6. Convert Data → Reason for Change
Here’s how you connect data to action:
Data Observation	What It Means	Change Justified
Large output swings	No standard work	Standard roles & flow
Same headcount, different results	Layout dependent	Dedicated zones
Performance drops during certain blocks	Staffing transitions	Staffing modes
Over 200% bursts	Rush-driven chaos	Rush job protocol
This table alone can win approval.
________________________________________
7. How You Present This (Very Important)
You do NOT show leadership the raw sheet.
You show:
1.	One chart (output vs time)
2.	One table (avg by staffing)
3.	One conclusion slide
Example conclusion:
“Historical data shows inconsistent performance caused by lack of standard flow, unclear roles during staffing changes, and space congestion. The proposed changes directly target these root causes.”
That’s it.
________________________________________
8. After Changes: How You Use the Same Data Again
This is the powerful part.
You collect the same data format after changes, then show:
•	Variability ↓
•	Output more stable
•	Fewer extreme highs/lows
📌 That proves:
•	The change worked
•	You didn’t just “rearrange things”
•	You controlled the process

1. First: What This Report Proves (Frame It Correctly)
This report already contains everything leadership needs:
•	Time windows (Start–Stop)
•	Headcount (Emps)
•	Actual labor hours (ActManHr)
•	Target labor hours (TgtManHr)
•	Output (Pc / KG)
•	Calculated Efficiency %
•	Department split (FINALPACK vs SAP-IPT)
👉 This is a historical performance baseline under non-standardized conditions.
Use that phrase.
________________________________________
2. The Single Biggest Insight: Efficiency Is NOT Stable
Just scanning the Efficiency column shows:
•	20%
•	70%
•	100%
•	200%+
•	600%+
•	1000%+
What that means (important):
•	The process is not controlled
•	Efficiency is being driven by:
o	Job mix
o	Staffing gaps
o	Layout constraints
o	Rush behavior
•	Not by standard work
📌 Leadership takeaway:
“Performance varies wildly even with the same headcount and time blocks.”
This alone justifies change.
________________________________________
3. Separate FINALPACK from SAP-IPT (Critical)
Do this first in Excel:
•	Filter Dept = FINALPACK
•	Ignore SAP-IPT for now
Why?
•	You are improving Final Pack
•	Mixing departments hides the signal
Once filtered, calculate:
•	Avg efficiency
•	Min / max efficiency
•	Std deviation (optional but powerful)
📌 Message:
“Final Pack performance shows extreme variability, indicating lack of standardized flow and role clarity.”
________________________________________
4. Use Headcount to Prove the Need for Staffing Modes
Now filter by Emps:
•	2
•	3
•	4
For each group, calculate:
•	Avg Efficiency
•	Avg KG/hour
•	Avg Pc/hour
What you will see (guaranteed):
•	Same headcount → very different results
•	Some 2-person periods outperform 3-person
•	Some 4-person periods perform worse than 2-person
📌 This directly justifies:
•	Staffing Modes (A/B/C)
•	Role assignment by headcount
•	Job limits per mode
Use this line:
“Headcount alone does not guarantee performance — the operating model must change with staffing.”
________________________________________
5. Use ActManHr vs TgtManHr to Expose Waste
This column pair is gold.
Interpret it like this:
•	Act > Target → inefficiency, waiting, searching, congestion
•	Act < Target → rushing, unsustainable pace, overburden
From your data:
•	Both happen frequently
•	Sometimes back-to-back
📌 Leadership message:
“The process alternates between underutilization and overburden, which creates instability and risk.”
That’s Lean + Safety language.
________________________________________
6. Use Time Blocks to Show Disruption Periods
Group data by:
•	Early shift
•	Mid shift
•	Late shift
•	Break-adjacent periods
You will likely see:
•	Drops during staffing transitions
•	Spikes during rush periods
•	Inconsistent output per 30–60 min window
📌 This justifies:
•	Mode switching rules
•	One-job-at-a-time limits
•	Dedicated staging zones
________________________________________
7. Turn the Data Into a Clear “Why Change” Table
Use this exact structure in a slide or email:
Data Evidence	What It Tells Us	Change Justified
Efficiency ranges from 20%–600%+	Process not standardized	Standard work
Same headcount, different output	Roles unclear	Staffing modes
ActManHr fluctuates widely	Motion & waiting waste	Layout zoning
High spikes followed by drops	Rush chaos	Rush job protocol
This table alone can approve your project.
________________________________________
8. How You Position the Changes (Very Important)
Do NOT say:
“We rearranged things to improve flow”
Say:
“Based on two years of pack performance data, we implemented controls to stabilize output, reduce variability, and protect performance during staffing changes.”
That’s executive language.
________________________________________
9. How You Use This SAME Report After Changes
This is the power move.
After implementation:
•	Run the same report
•	Filter FINALPACK
•	Compare:
o	Avg efficiency
o	Variability (spread)
o	Act vs Target stability
📌 Success is NOT higher peaks
📌 Success is less spread
That proves:
•	Sustainability
•	Control
•	Engineering rigor
Morning (30–45 minutes total)
Step 1 — Baseline Snapshot (10 min)
Before changing anything:
•	Take 2 photos of the current pack area
•	Note:
o	Headcount
o	Active jobs
o	Congestion points
📌 This is your “before”.
________________________________________
Step 2 — Team Huddle (10 min)
Keep it simple. Say this:
“Today we’re testing a new pack flow to reduce confusion and rehandling.
We’ll adjust roles based on how many of us are here.
I need you to follow it exactly so we can see if it works.”
No debate. No theory.
________________________________________
Step 3 — Set the Mode (5 min)
Declare it out loud:
•	“We are in Mode B – 3 people” (or A/C)
Assign roles by person, not title.
________________________________________
Step 4 — Physically Mark Zones (15 min)
Use:
•	Tape
•	Pallets
•	Skids
•	Signs if available
Minimum zones:
•	Active Job
•	Finished Goods
•	IPT / Incoming
📌 Physical boundaries matter more than instructions.
________________________________________
🔁 During the Shift (This Is Critical)
Rule #1: DO NOT FIX EVERYTHING
If something goes wrong:
•	Write it down
•	Do NOT redesign mid-shift unless safety is at risk
You’re testing the system, not reacting.
________________________________________
Rule #2: Capture Simple Data Only
Every 2 hours, record:
•	Headcount
•	Mode
•	Output (skids / bundles)
•	Interruptions (yes/no)
•	Comments (1 sentence)
That’s it.
________________________________________
🧪 What Success Looks Like (Very Important)
Success tomorrow is NOT:
❌ Highest output ever
❌ Everyone happy
❌ Zero issues
Success IS:
✅ Fewer half-started jobs
✅ Clear ownership
✅ Less walking/searching
✅ Output more predictable
Write that down.
________________________________________
📸 End of Shift (15 minutes)
Step 1 — After Photos
Take photos of:
•	Finished zone
•	Active job area
•	Overall cleanliness
________________________________________
Step 2 — Quick Debrief (5 min)
Ask only 2 questions:
1.	“Was it clearer who was doing what?”
2.	“What slowed us down the most?”
No open discussion.
________________________________________
📊 What You Will Show Leadership the Next Day
You’ll have:
•	Before / after photos
•	Mode used
•	Output by mode
•	List of issues discovered
Use this line:
“The pilot showed improved flow clarity and reduced rehandling. Next step is refining role balance and formalizing the standard.”
That’s how pilots are supposed to sound.
PART 1 — BEFORE Study (Baseline)
If possible, do at least 2–3 hours before implementing changes.
If not tomorrow, use historical observation for comparison.
________________________________________
📋 BEFORE Time Study Table (Per Job)
Job	Pre-Pack Start	Pack Start	Pack End	Post-Pack End	Stop Time (min)	Notes
From this calculate:
•	Pre-Pack Time
•	Pack Time
•	Post-Pack Time
•	Total Flow Time
•	Total Stop Time
________________________________________
📊 BEFORE Block Summary (2-Hour Blocks)
Block	Jobs Completed	Total Pack Time (min)	Total Stop Time (min)	% Time Stopped
7–9				
9–11				
% Time Stopped Formula:
Total Stop TimeTotal Available Labor Time\frac{\text{Total Stop Time}}{\text{Total Available Labor Time}}Total Available Labor TimeTotal Stop Time 
Available Labor Time =
2 people × 120 minutes = 240 minutes per block
________________________________________
PART 2 — AFTER Study (Pilot with New Roles)
Use the same tables.
That’s critical.
Do not change measurement method.
________________________________________
📋 AFTER Time Study Table (Same Format)
Job	Pre-Pack Start	Pack Start	Pack End	Post-Pack End	Stop Time (min)	Notes
________________________________________
📊 AFTER Block Summary
Block	Jobs Completed	Total Pack Time (min)	Total Stop Time (min)	% Time Stopped
7–9				
________________________________________
PART 3 — What to Compare
Now you compare BEFORE vs AFTER on 5 metrics:
________________________________________
1️⃣ Average Pack Time Per Job
Did it:
•	Decrease?
•	Stay similar but more consistent?
Consistency matters more than raw speed.
________________________________________
2️⃣ Stop Time Per Block
This is the most important metric.
If stop time decreases → your system improved.
Example:
Before:
•	60 min stopped per block
After:
•	25 min stopped per block
That’s real impact.
________________________________________
3️⃣ % Time Stopped
If:
Before = 25%
After = 10%
That’s strong evidence.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Flow Time Variability
Look at:
Longest job flow time
Shortest job flow time
If the range shrinks → system is stabilizing.
________________________________________
5️⃣ Pack Interruptions During Active Transfer
Count how many times packing stopped mid-transfer.
This should reduce significantly.
________________________________________
🎯 What Success Looks Like
You do NOT need:
•	30% faster packing
•	Huge output increase
You need:
✅ Less stop time
✅ Less mid-pack cutting
✅ Fewer role switches
✅ More consistent job completion time
That proves your theory.
________________________________________
PART 4 — How You Present It
Create one simple comparison slide:
Metric	Before	After	Change
Avg Pack Time			
Stop Time per Block			
% Time Stopped			
Flow Time Range			
Then say:
“By separating pre-pack and material prep and protecting the pack phase, we reduced interruption time and stabilized job flow under the same staffing level.”
________________________________________
🚨 Important Engineering Rule
If output does not increase immediately but stop time decreases —
that is still a success.
Stability precedes speed.
________________________________________
🧠 Advanced Tip (Optional but Strong)
If you want to go one level deeper:
Track:
Value-Add Time = Pack Time
Non-Value-Add Time = Stop Time
Then calculate:
Value-Add Ratio=Pack TimeTotal Labor Time\text{Value-Add Ratio} = \frac{\text{Pack Time}}{\text{Total Labor Time}}Value-Add Ratio=Total Labor TimePack Time 
If that ratio increases → strong proof of improvement.
